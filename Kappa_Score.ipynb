    "# Kappa Score\n",
    "Cohen’s kappa measures the agreement between two raters who each classify N items into C mutually exclusive categories. A simple way to think this is that Cohen’s Kappa is a quantitative measure of reliability for two raters that are rating the same thing, corrected for how often that the raters may agree by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating Cohen’s Kappa\n",
    "The value for kappa can range between 0 -1. A score of 0 means that there is random agreement among raters, whereas a score of 1 means that there is a complete agreement between the raters. However, a score that is less than 0 means that there is less agreement than chance.\n",
    "Lastly, the formula for Cohen’s Kappa is the probability of agreement take away the probability of random agreement divided by 1 minus the probability of random agreement.\n",

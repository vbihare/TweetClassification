    "2. [TF-IDF](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html): This is an additional transformation that is common when working with text data.  It uses statistical properties of the dataset to assign weights to text terms.  You can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).\n",
    "3. [Classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html): Finally, we classify data that was transformed by the previous two steps.  In this case we are using a linear support vector classifier, which is commonly used in text classification tasks.
